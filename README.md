# Bliffoscope Mission
### Problem Statement

It's April 1, 2143. Your job is to save the world.
Well, a little world. Specifically the asteroid X8483-Z-32 that you and Alphonso Bliffageri are stuck on.
You've been stranded there ever since the evil Rejectos hit your spaceship with a slime torpedo fired from
one of their spaceships. Now you and Alphonso are trying to save your little world from a concerted Rejectos attack.
The main problem you have is detecting the Rejectos spaceships and slime torpedos, because they're protected with
cloaking devices. Alphonso has invented an imaging anti-neutrino system (which he has modestly named the “Bliffoscope”)
that provides the only information you have about their location, but it's not very good information. First,
the Bliffoscope only detects whether there are anti-neutrinos at any particular point on an image,
not what their intensity is. In other words, the data it provides is the equivalent of a black-and-white image.
Second, the data is very noisy – even if there are no targets in a particular area, some pixels will be “on”,
and if there is a target, some of its pixels will be “off”.

### Objective of project

1. Methodology to detect torpedos and starships out of Bliffoscope data

2. Bulding UI around the same methodology
